- **Voice Analysis**: Extracts characteristics (gender, age, tone)
- **Fingerprinting**: Creates unique voice signatures
- **Quality Scoring**: Rates voice model quality (0-100)

### Speech Generation
- **Cloned Voice Synthesis**: Generate speech using user's voice
- **Background Music**: Integration with audio mixing system
- **Professional Effects**: Reverb, echo, compression, normalization
- **Format Output**: High-quality WAV audio files

## üìã API Methods

### RealVoiceCloningService

```python
# Create a voice clone from user audio samples
clone_result = await service.create_user_voice_clone(
    user_id="user123",
    voice_name="My Personal Voice",
    audio_files=["/path/to/sample1.wav", "/path/to/sample2.wav", ...],
    description="My custom AI voice"
)

# Generate speech with cloned voice
speech_result = await service.generate_user_cloned_speech(
    voice_id="voice_id_123",
    text="Hello, this is my cloned voice!",
    user_id="user123"
)

# Get user's voice clones
voices = service.get_user_voices(user_id="user123")

# Delete a voice clone
success = service.delete_user_voice(voice_id="voice_id_123", user_id="user123")
```

### TTSService Integration

```python
# Generate speech with voice cloning + background music + effects
final_audio = await tts_service.generate_user_voice_audio(
    text="Hello from my personalized AI voice!",
    voice_id="voice_id_123",
    user_id="user123",
    background_music=True,
    effects={
        'reverb': 0.2,
        'compression': 0.4,
        'normalization': True
    }
)
```
